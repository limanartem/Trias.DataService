2008 02 12 V1.3 draft
=====================================
2007 10  17 
      Add Situation Exchange & Facility Exchange services.
      Added a  siri_all-v1.2.xsd, ifopt_allStopPlace-v0.3.xsd, acsp_all.xsd packages to force explicit declaration of all elements in an imported namespace on the first reference. This overcomes a limitation of some XML tools that only pick up thos elements on the first import and ignotre all subsequent imports.

    Name Space improvements
        revise to use explicit namespaces
        Change name space :  http://siri.org.uk/ ==? siri.org.uk/siri

         Revise SpecialNeeds to use  acsb package
